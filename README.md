# Mental Health and Chronic Illness Prediction
==============================

## Project Description
This project investigates the relationship between chronic illness and psychological distress at a global scale. Using public datasets on mental health prevalence, disease burden (DALYs), and treatment access gaps, the analysis explores trends in depression and anxiety rates associated with chronic illness. A predictive modeling approach using linear regression was implemented to forecast depression prevalence based on chronic illness indicators. This project aims to contribute to public health understanding and early intervention efforts by identifying structural predictors of mental health outcomes.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following Python packages:

- Python 3.9+
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- scipy

You can install them all via pip:
